# AdvancedControlSystems
Assignments for the Advanced Control Systems course @ UNIVR

The dissertation for this project can be found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rtrqptrcxzhm).

## Robot model
A symbolic model for the provided `.urdf` file can be found inside the `kinematics` and `dynamics` folders. A numerical approach is also available in order to compare the results with the ones from the _Robotics System Toolbox from MATLAB_. 

## Control schemes
All the discussed schemes can be found in the `simulink` folder. So far, the _Parallel Force/Position Controller_ is still not working probably due to singularity issues.
